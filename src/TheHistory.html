                The Niagara Falls was first settled by Loyalists who supported the British during the American Revolution in 1776. They settle this area as they ran from persecution due to their support of the British. Although they settle in many places, one of the places they settles was Niagara Falls. There were two settlements that are important to the development of the Niagara Falls. The first was the Chippawa which became a village in 1850 and the next was Drummondville which also incorporated in 1850. Another small village named Elgin merged with a smaller community named Clifton in 1856. In 1881, Clifton decides that they will change their name to the Town of Niagara Falls while Drummondville changes their name to the Village of Niagara Falls in 1882. These two cities then merge together into the City of Niagara Falls in the year 1904. The City of Niagara Falls kept expands allowing them to merge with Chippawa, Willoughby Township, and small areas of Crowland Township in 1970. (“A Short Heritage of Niagara Falls, Canada.”)
